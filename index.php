 * As you may have noticed, there are php templates in this theme :) (except for
 * searchform.php)
 *
 * This theme renders *everything* using the Timber Template Hierarchy. At the
 * moment there is no need for PHP templates. In the future, the theme may need
 * more logic, like in compiling a title for archives. This could be done in one
 * of the theme classes, or in PHP templates. Time will tell..
