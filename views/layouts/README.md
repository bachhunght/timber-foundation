# Layouts

This folder contains the different layouts for the theme. There is nothing spectacular, just the basic no sidebar (full-width or narrow and centered), sidebar (left and right). To keep things are DRY as possible, the sidebar templates both extend a single sidebar template, just changing the layout by altering the classes.

You can see how the separation of concerns makes the layout in Timber Regions very easy to manipulate!
