This is a good example of where complex logic has moved to the theme controller,
but the 'display logic' is still handled by simply loading a view. Timber Regions
takes care of loading pagination where necessary by including this file. This
file in turn renders pagination through the complex pagination function defined
in `TimberFoundationTemplate::pagination` and added in
`TimberFoundationSite::add_to_twig`.
