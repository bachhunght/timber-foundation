# Wrappers

Most sites will only need a single wrapper. And that single wrapper will look a lot like the default Timber Regions wrapper. This theme comes an alternative default wrapper that adds responsive header regions. It also comes with a custom wrapper for Foundation's offcanvas layouts. See the comments in both wrappers to see how powerful this can be.
