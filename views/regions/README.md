# Regions

One can see how regions are the central concept in Timber Regions by the sheer volume of regions templates this basic theme comes with. This theme has 3 regions more than Timber Regions: an offcanvas menu, a small screen header region and a large screen header region. All header region templates can be loaded into any of the responsive header regions.

By implementing Foundation components like tab bar and top bar into region templates, this theme becomes a framework by which a developer can puzzle together a complete Foundation site by simply selecting which components he wants to display when and where. No need for copying HTML markup!

Which region is displayed where is mainly a theme option and page template thing. To see how the regions are loaded, check out `lib/theme-options.php`.
